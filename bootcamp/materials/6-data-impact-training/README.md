# Data visualization and impact

## The types of impact you can have as a data engineer
- Measurable: Efficiency improvements and experimentation outcomes
- Hard-to-measure: Quality improvements, team enablement outcomes 
- Immesurable: Changing intuitions, team culture improvements, being a "glue" person.

## Translate time into value as a DE:
- Supplying insights
	- Reinforce intuitions
	- Contradict intuitions
	- Fail to support or contradict intuitions

	- Insights are often Over valuated: and you can know this when: 
		- A "crisis" happen
		- You start feeling burnt out
		- Long-term planning disappears
		- AD HOC request HELL 

    ==> Don't be afraid to say NO!
    ==> Leverage your manage for support
    ==> Communicate that robust data models are better than one-off pipelines!

- Preventing bugs and maintaining data trust:
    - Quality checks
    - Documentation
    - Good engineering practices!
    - Clear expectations (SLAs, documented gaps)
    - This type of value is ofter UNDER VALUATED because it's harder to measure

- Increasing pipeline efficiencies:
    -Proper data modeling
    - Improving Oncall processes
    - Reducing data volumes (compressions (parquet)/ re-sampling ...)
    - Picking the right tool for the job(migrations)
    - Simplifying model and reducing capabilities a little bit
    
- Enabling other engineers to work faster
- Persuading decision makers to use data
