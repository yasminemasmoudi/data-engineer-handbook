# Homework

- Make two dashboards with Tableau public
  - an executive dashboard that illustrates different stuff than in the lab
  - an exploratory dashboard with filters
  - You can use the `match_details`, `matches`, `medals`, `medals_matches_players` datasets in `3-spark-fundamentals` instead if click stream data is too boring
  

Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public and submit the link in a PR on Github
